   * The following 3 queries help averaging data over different time intervals.
   * The data at a given time is always part of it's above time interval point.
   * For example in hourly interval, data at 08:26 will be included in the value at 09:00
   * and the value at 09:00:00.001 will be averaged with the value at 10:00.
   * The idea is to have round time value, to ease the charts reading, rather than averaging at 08:59:59.999
   * Have a look at `HashrateServiceSpec` for multiple examples
